# Moonlander Simulator
This Python project allowed me to improve my knowledge and skills in Python functional programming and string manipulation. The program simulates a moonlander based on altitude, velocity, amount of fuel, and rate of fuel consumption. To run it, make sure you have all the files in a directory then run this command:
```
$ python3 moonlander.py
```

I am always trying to learn from my mistakes, so please [provide feedback or suggestions for improvement](https://github.com/BenClark1/ptap_ads1115/issues). Your input is much appreciated.
